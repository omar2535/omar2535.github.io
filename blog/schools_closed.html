As the term began, something loomed over our heads. We all knew that there were reports of a supervirus that was coming our way. We didn't know how bad it would be. China had shut down the city of Wuhan and isolated many other cities in the Hubei province. Other countries watched while others argued that this is a violation to human rights. In hindsight, this might have been the best rulebook that other countries should have followed sooner.</p> <p>In around January, something perculiar happened. UBC closed on a school day for the first time in my four years there due to snow! That was unprecendented and caused a slight set-back in some of my courses.</p> <p>Fast foward to february, when the WHO started raising the alarms of a potential pandemic. Despite the warnings to contain the epedemic, many countries still simply chose to ignore the obvious signals. Schools in Canada were still open and the markets were in a huge upswing.</p> <p>Then all of a sudden, the music stopped.</p> <p>Italy shut down their borders. An unprecedented move that seems like only China could pull off. One of the first major signs that the virus was spreading all over the world.</p> <p>In an attempt to boost spending amid this COVID19 slump, the feds and bank of canada decides to lower interest rates. This didn't help much.</p> <p>A few days after Italy announced their shut down, the markets crashed.
More countries annouced borders were closing while the Ontario government shut down universities. Public schools had their spring break extended by 2 weeks effectively becoming a month long &quot;spring break&quot; while regular office workers were told to work from home if possible.</p> <p>Universities accross Canada shut down as UBC and SFU were the last 2 remaining. Official statements stated that UBC could only shut down under the directives from the provincial government.</p> <p>Only a handful number of students in class sizes of hundreds remained. My computer science class where it was usually hard to find seats bacame so empty I could sit whereever I liked. Then, at roughly 5pm, the announcement came.</p> <p>UBC shut down.</p> <p>This caused many anxiety and stress, while giving others relief that they don't have to risk themselves by going to school. While I am relieved that UBC closed, I am also frustrated that my midterm exams are now online instead.</p> <p>It is now only march, with 2 full months of school left. While UBC is closed for the rest of the term, nobody knows how final exams will be held. However, the classes going online may be a good thing for UBC.</p> <p>UBC has always been lacking in their distance education department. Most universities have lectures recorded in case students miss their classes. However, most courses at UBC don't offer this. Transitioning to online course content will also mean that most lectures will be recorded.</p> <p>Only time will tell how this pandemic turns out.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"><!----><!----></div></div>
